Subject: AP-BPM CFP





Dear Chairs and committee members of AP-BPM,





Thank you again for your serving as chairs or committee members of AP-BPM. Attached is the CFP of 1st AP-BPM conference, which is contributed by the program chairs (Dr. Minseok Song, Dr. Moe Thandar Wynn, and Dr. Jianxun Liu).

I would like to ask you to distribute it to as many people related as possible, and encourage them to submit papers to the conference.

And I would kindly invite you all to the first event of AP-BPM in Beijing too.

If you have anything required to know further, feel free to contact me or the program chairs.

Looking forward to seeing you in AP-BPM 2013.
